# Introduction

As part of our final project for our User Interface Design and Development (CS160) course at the University of California, Berkeley, we were tasked with building an application that leverages concepts of cool media. Our assignment was open ended, and our only constraint was that we could not design for ourselves. Using user-centric design principles, we brainstormed, researched, observed, and prototyped, implemented and evaluated our application.

We created an application geared towards upper elementary and lower middle school students. Our application is a learning tool, with interactive tasks that teach you academic concepts before you read the text. We swayed from the traditional approach towards education, which would be to provide definitions, textbook reading, and assignments that quiz dry knowledge. Instead, our application has the user read last and interact with the real world first. By completing our tasks, users will fully understand how concepts that are learned in the classroom can have a real world impact. It is our goal that by engaging users, they will have the desire to be more creative and be progress oriented students.
